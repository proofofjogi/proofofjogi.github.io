						The
						<a
							class="link link-primary"
							href="https://australiancitizenshiptests.com/test"
							>Australian Citizenship
							Test Preparation App</a
						>
						was written to make studying
						for the Australian
						citizenship test easier and
						more effective by giving
						users convenient access to
						study materials, interactive
						learning features, and
						up-to-date information.
					</p>
					<div

							Go to the App
						</a>
					</div>
					<p>
						If you're applying to become
						an Australian citizen, odds
						are pretty high that you
						will have to sit the
						citizenship test. Almost
						every citizen by conferal
						has to undergo the test,
						there are not many
						exceptions.
					</p>
					<p>
						My wife was amongst the
						esteemed testees recently
						(is testee a word? If it is
						not, it should be) and she
						told me that there are no
						good citizenship test apps
						on the market.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are some that predate
						this app, but my wife did
						not like any of them and
						asked me for help:
						<span class="italic"
							>"Please write me an
							app"</span
						>
					</p>
					<h2
						class="text-2xl font-bold"
					>
						Not as hard as it sounds
					</h2>
					<p>
						Since I know how to write
						web apps, I decided to help
						her. The task was quite
						manageable, this is a small
						problem to solve and coding
						it does not take all that
						long. From memory, it took
						me something like 2 weeks to
						write this thing at about 2
						hours per day and the app
						has been chugging along fine
						ever since. My wife used the
						app to prepare herself for
						her test.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are quite happy that we
						did it this way, because my
						wife ended up passing her
						test with flying colours and
						she's an Australian citizen
						now. Well done honey!
					</p>
					<p>
						If you're in a similar
						position, and you also need
						to pass your Australian
						Citizenship test, preferably
						on your first attempt,
						consider giving the
						<a
							href="https://australiancitizenshiptests.com/test"
							class="link link-primary"
							>Australian Citizenship
							Tests App</a
						>
						a go.
