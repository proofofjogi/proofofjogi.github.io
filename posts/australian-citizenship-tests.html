						The
						<a

							href="https://australiancitizenshiptests.com/test"
							>Australian Citizenship
							Test Preparation App</a
						>
						was written to makes
						studying for the Australian
						citizenship test easier and
						more effective by giving
						users convenient access to
						study materials, interactive
						learning features, and
						up-to-date information.

					<p>
						If you're applying to become
						an Australian citizen, odds
						are pretty high that you
						will have to sit the
						citzenship test. Almost
						every citizen by conferal
						has to undergo the test,
						there are not many
						exceptions.
					</p>
					<p>
						My wife was amonst the
						esteemed testees recetly (is
						testee a word? If it is not,
						it should be) and she told
						me that there are no good
						citizenship test apps on the
						market.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are some that predate
						this my app, but my wife did
						not like any of them and
						asked me for help.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since I know how to write
						web apps, I did so for her
						problem and she used the app
						to prepare herself for her
						test.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are quite happy that we
						did it this way, because my
						wife ended up passing her
						test with flying colours and
						she's an Australian citizen
						now. Well done honey!
					</p>
					<p>
						If you're in a similar
						position, consider giving
						the
						<a
							href="https://australiancitizenshiptests.com/test"
							class="link link-primary"
							>Australian Citizenship
							Tests App</a
						>
						a go.
