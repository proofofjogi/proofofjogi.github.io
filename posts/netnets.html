						is scratching my own itch. I
						like net nets. Most stocks I
						ever owned were net nets. To
						the extend that I own
						stocks, I like them to be
						net nets. <br />
						That's because net nets are
						awesome. They outperform
						market averages over time.
						There's about 100 years of
						literature on the matter.
						<br />
						But screening for net nets
						can be a pain. Most
						screeners are not very good
						for quick high level stock
						overviews. I wanted to fix
						that.
